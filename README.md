# Drum Machine
A project used to learn react + redux. All state is stored in the redux store.

## Features
* Play Sounds: Click on drumpads or press the respective labelled key to play a midi sound.
* Circle Toggle: Powers the drum machine on and off. Renders null keypress and mouseclicks.
* Square Toggle: Switches between soundbanks. Just used free code camp soundbanks. May change in the future.
* Display: small display which displays the name of a played sound. Names and sounds are from a free code camp AWS link.
